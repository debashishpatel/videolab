## Prerequisites

Before diving into this project, ensure you have a solid understanding of:

- **JavaScript (ES6+ Features)**: Promises, Async/Await, Callbacks, Modules (`import/export`), Arrow functions, `this`, Closures, etc.
- **HTML & CSS** (optional but helpful)
- **Basic Terminal Commands**
- **Basic Git & GitHub**

## Getting Started with Node.js

To get started:

1. **Install Node.js and npm**: Download and install from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **Understand Node.js Fundamentals**:
   - Event Loop
   - V8 Engine
   - Global Objects (`__dirname`, `__filename`, `process`)
   - CommonJS & ES Modules
   - npm (Node Package Manager)
   - `package.json` & `package-lock.json`
3. **Run a Simple Script**: Create a JavaScript file and execute it using `node filename.js`.
